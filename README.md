  ...and more...

## Notes
- Create a `~/.gitconfig-email` file to set your git email. This is so that my personal and work machines can use different git accounts.
- Yadm config is set up with the `remote` as `git@personal...`; `Host personal` is configured in `~/.ssh/config` to go to github and use my personal key. None of this should matter until I need to set up a new work computer one day.
- `yadm add | commit | push | pull | clone` to set up

## TODO
- [ ] Replace kitty with Ghostty, add Ghostty configs.
- [ ] Clean up brewfile
- [ ] Maybe get rid of `borders`, `superfile`
